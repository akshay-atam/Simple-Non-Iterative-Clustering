This project was a part of Optional End of Course Projects from CS 558 Computer Vision at Stevens Institute of Technology. It is a python implementation of Simple Non Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm which uses a non-iterative approach as opposed to the popular Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). Being a non-linear approach, it saves computation complexity and makes the algorithm faster than SLIC.
